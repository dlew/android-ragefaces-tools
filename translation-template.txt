This is the template email to send to potential translators when they ask if
you need any translation help.  Make sure to replace <LANGUAGE> with the
language they offer to help translate!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey,


Thanks for offering to help!


The language file can be found here: https://github.com/dlew/android-ragefaces/raw/master/res/values/strings.xml


Essentially, everything in between the <string> tags should be translated. Â (Unless a <LANGUAGE> would prefer the original text - for example, some translators in the past felt that "Me Gusta" should remain thus, because it's already in Spanish.)  For example, this string:


<string name="err_sd_not_mounted">SD card must be mounted to use Rage Faces - problem?</string>


Would become this:


<string name="err_sd_not_mounted">Some <LANGUAGE> text</string>


I've left comments (in <!-- ... -->) above each string to try to clarify the usage of each string.


Let me know if you have any questions!  Also, what name you'd like to have credited.
